# [Solid](https://github.com/ryansolid/solid/) Form Action


This package provides a function that accepts a definition of the initial state of your form, its validation, and submission, returning a number of dynamically generated (and fully typed) actions, functions, and state objects that you can attach to your form, handling validation and submission for you.

See [the example](example/src/App.tsx) for usage.
